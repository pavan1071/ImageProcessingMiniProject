# Image Processing Mini Project
__Face Mask Detection__

**Download the 'dataset' folder from here** - [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pEcEzpmA1aCwWRwO6p-a5ZQbzITG1ZdS?usp=sharing)

**Training the model**   
**Steps :**  
i.Open 'Train_FaceMaskDetect_Model.ipynb' in google colab   
ii.Upload the 'dataset' folder in your drive  
iii.Update the path of 'dataset' folder in google colab  
iv.Run the code and train the model  
v.Download the model - 'mask_detector.model' 

**Detection of face mask by using trained model**

**a.In real time:**  
i.Open 'detect_mask_live.py'  
ii.Update the paths of face detector, saved model  
iii.Run it  

**b.For given video as input:**  
i.Open 'detect_mask_video.py'  
ii.Keep a sample video in the current directory  
iii.Update the paths of face detector, saved model and sample video  
iv.Run it
